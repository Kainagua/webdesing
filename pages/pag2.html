<h2 align="center"> About Us <h2>
<br>
</br>
<h3 align="center"> <ul>BVL Futebol was founded in 2011 by three very good friends and business partners </ul>
<ul>with the aim of being a information and sales platform about football. </ul>
<ul>“About Us” page focuses on the future as much as the past, we have legends in football </ul>
<ul>who were discovered decades ago as good as the greats discovered in this generation. </ul>
<ul>And we're here to share information from all generations of football.</ul>
<br>
</br>
<ul>The company is focused on informing its users about football in general, in World Cup years, </ul>
<ul>the focus is entirely on the edition in question. The company is about business, and the page </ul>
<ul>immediately flows into a section on culture and history.</ul>
<br>
</br>
<ul>With this culture, history and information section, BVL Futebol focuses on people, </ul>
<ul>people who create and participate in some way in the company and not just focus on itself. </ul>
<ul>This is a subtle change from some of the other “About Us” pages, here we are focused on the team as a whole.</ul>
<br>
</br>
<ul>It is centered around its “users and employees” who make this page what it is, 
<ul>through this message, the company highlights that all its employees are </ul>
<ul>proactively building a product and are “manufacturers” by right own.</ul>
<br>
</br>
<ul>BVL Futebol offers a high-level look at your company, its content and those who build it.</ul>
<br>
</br>
<ul> Sincerely, the board.</ul>
