			<p>The football world cup is an event held between nations since 1930, this one being suggested by a Frenchman. 
			Had its first edition with only 16 countries participating and was held in Uruguay - south america where it was victorious.

			From then on, other editions were always held every 4 years and at the moment we have what are called "the favorite countries", which would be those that have already won a cup.
			Currently Brazil is the country with the highest number of victories (5) followed by Germany and Italy with (4) Argentina, France and Uruguay (2) and finally England and Spain (1).

			What can be said is that in the 21 editions there are only 8 countries that had the opportunity to achieve this title. But there are those who have come close to it many times. 
			The 2022 edition was an edition of many surprises, as some countries with less influence in big football achieved prominent positions and even unusual rankings.
			One case is Morocco, a team with a more humble squad and without big names in football, managed the feat of beating teams with quality and players from the first league such as Spain and Portugal, 
			in addition to the classification of the group stage having eliminated Belgium another country that usually stands out in the big cups.<br>

			Others that didn't go so far but still had the ability to eliminate other good countries were Japan and South Korea, which left behind Uruguay and Germany.<br>

			What can be said is that this edition has no parameters and that everyone can still have a chance, from the favorite to the “under Dogs”, after all, 
			Morocco won all the games with no more than 41% of ball possession. What matters is what you do when you're with her and at the end of it all, just one goal is enough.
			Let's wait for the next results and see what else this cup has in store for us, where do you intend to bet your chips?
