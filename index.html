 <h2 align="center"> Favorite Teams To Win The World Cup 2022! </h2>
 <br>
</br>
 <h3 align="center"><ul> Much has been speculated about the favorite teams to win the 2022 world cup, </ul>
<ul> weeks before the start of the games people were already placing their bets on who would reach the quarterfinals, </ul>
 <ul>semifinals and final and also who would be the winner of the 2022 edition. From the beginning, </ul>
 <ul>4 countries were mentioned that would be strong candidates to lift the trophy, </ul>
 <ul>and these are the teams: Argentina, Brazil, England and France.</ul></h3>
 <br>

</div> </h5>

<br>
</br>
 

<h3 align="center"><ul> Unfortunately two of the four bets have already been eliminated in the quarterfinals, </ul>
<ul>following only the other two big favorites, which are: Argentina and France and they are going to play against each other on the 18th of December,</ul> 
<ul>both teams are on the finals, and the question remains, who do you think will win the 2022 world cup? Argentina or France? </ul>
<ul>Place your bets, say which one you think or want to win and I would say risk the final score of the match.</ul>
